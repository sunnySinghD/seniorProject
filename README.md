seniorProject
This is my senior project from my Advanced Software Engineering course. It was developed as a group project and is basically an online interface in php with a database. I'm much more comfortable in back end source coding such as Java, C, or C++ but I am familiar with such programming after this course. Also the software engineering concepts I learned in this class such as Agile development and documentation were really useful when I got to apply them in an actual work environment.
